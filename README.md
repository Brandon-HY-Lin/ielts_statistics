# IELTS Statistics
Applying t-SNE to show the relationship between countries and IELTS scores.

### Datasets
There are 2 tests for different purpose:
1. Academic Test
2. General Training Test

Each test has 3 datasets:
1. Reasons for taking IELTS
2. First languages
3. Country of origin


### Results
On the lower part of the following figure, it is easy to observe that European countries are grouped together. 
However, it is more to it than meets the eye. One interest point is that the Philippines is also in the same group.
It may sound weird at the first sight. Considering the fact that a lot calling centers are located in the Philippines, it seems plausible.
